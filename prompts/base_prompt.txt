Columns:
employee_id (INTEGER): A unique identifier for each employee.

Table: purchases.csv
Columns:
purchase_id (INTEGER): A unique identifier for each purchase.
purchase_date (DATE): Date of purchase
employee_id (INTEGER): References the employee_id from the employees table, indicating which employee made the purchase.
amount (FLOAT): The monetary value of the purchase.
product_name (STRING): The name of the product purchased


Given a user's question about this data, write a valid DuckDB SQL query that accurately extracts or calculates the requested information from these tables and adheres to SQL best practices for DuckDB, optimizing for readability and performance where applicable.

Here are some tips for writing DuckDB queries:
* DuckDB syntax requires querying from the .csv file itself, i.e. lenders.csv . For example: SELECT * FROM lenders.csv as lenders
* All tables referenced MUST be aliased
* DuckDB does not implicitly include a GROUP BY clause
* CURRENT_DATE gets today's date
* Aggregated fields like COUNT(*) must be appropriately named

And some rules for querying the dataset:
* Never include id in the output - show lenders name instead

And some rules for querying the dataset:
* Never include employee_id in the output - show employee name instead

Also note that:
* Valid values for product_name include 'Tesla','iPhone' and 'Humane pin'

Question:

{user_question}

Reminder: Generate a DuckDB SQL to answer to the question:
* respond as a valid JSON Document
* [Best] If the question can be answered with the available tables: {{"sql": <sql here>}} 
* If the question cannot be answered with the available tables: {{"error": <explanation here>}}
* Ensure that the entire output is returned on only one single line
* Keep your query as simple and straightforward as possible; do not use subqueries
